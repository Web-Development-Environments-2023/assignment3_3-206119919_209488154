      <h1>Kubbeh</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Whose recipe:</strong> Shaked's Grandmother.</li>
        <li><strong>Customary preparation:</strong> Kubbeh Cuscous is a common dish for fridays dinners.</li>
        <li><strong>Components:</strong> For the dough: 2 cups semolina, 1 Tbsp canola oil, 1 tsp salt, 1 cup lukewarm water.
          For the filling: 1 Tbsp canola oil, 1 large onion, 1lb ground beef, ½ cup chopped parsley, 2 cloves garlic, 1 Tbsp baharat spice, 1 tsp salt, ¼ tsp black pepper.
          For the soup: 5 Tbsp canola oil, 1 large onion, 4 cups chopped celery, 4 peeled beets, 6 cups chicken stock, 4 cups water, ½ cup lemon juice, 4 Tbsp sugar, 1½ tsp salt, ¾ tsp black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Method of preparation:</strong> Start by making the dough. In a medium bowl mix the semolina, oil, and salt. Add the water and knead until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.
          Then make the filling. In a large sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Sauté the onion until translucent. Add the meat and cook while breaking it apart, for several minutes. Add the parsley, garlic, baharat, salt, and pepper and cook until the meat is browned. Drain most of the oil from the pan and set aside to cool. 
          Take the dough and pinch apart small balls about half the size of a golf ball. Roll it out into flat, thin rounds. Place a little less than a Tbsp meat in the center of the dough and bring the sides around it and pinch to seal. Pick it up and roll it in your hands a bit to form into a smooth ball. Place on a plate or baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and put in the refrigerator until ready to place in the soup.
          Using a large soup pot so that the kubbeh do not stick together, heat the canola oil over medium heat and then sauté the onion until translucent but not browned. Add the beets and celery and mix. Add the chicken stock and water and bring to a boil. Add the lemon juice, sugar, salt, and pepper. Cook for about 8-10 minutes. Gently add the kubbeh to the pot, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes-1 hour.</li>
